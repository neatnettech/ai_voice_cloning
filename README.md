# AI Voice Cloning

## alpha - wip

This project aims to clone a voice and use it to generate speech from written text. The goal is to create a proof of concept (PoC) where a user's voice is cloned and used to read text input.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to clone a voice and generate speech using that cloned voice. The core idea is to train a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model on a dataset of recorded voice and use it to synthesize speech from text.

## Features

- Voice Cloning
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion
- High-quality audio output
- Customizable and scalable deployment

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch or TensorFlow
- **Models:**
  - **Tacotron 2:** For TTS
  - **WaveGlow/MelGAN:** For vocoder
- **Pre-built Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - **Real-Time-Voice-Cloning** or **Coqui TTS**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-voice-cloning.git
    cd ai-voice-cloning
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up any additional dependencies as required by the chosen framework or model.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Record voice samples and save them in the `data/raw` directory.
   - Ensure each audio file is transcribed and aligned with the text.

2. **Preprocess Data:**
   - Run the preprocessing script to normalize audio and extract features.
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
